    "# A pivot table, but with less hassle!\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, we call a pivot table a ‘Group By’. \n",
    "\n",
    "You know you need one if you need to compare variables or aggregate values that are not readily available in your current data frame. For example, if you want to find out which cities and/or states have the greatest number of PPP loan recipients, you need to do a Group By. Think back to the Excel assessment: If you need to know the total number of violations each restaurant has received on all inspections combined, you need a Group By. \n",
    "\n",
    "The premise is the same as in Excel. First stop and think, what am I grouping by? In excel, you would put that column into rows. In Python, you just put it in parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, ask yourself, what am I measuring? In Excel, that would go into values. In python, that would go into brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, rather than clicking on that little ‘i” in the values box, in Python you write the action out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start this tutorial by importing the ppp loan data you've used for the last two tutorials. Remember, you'll need to assign it a name. (And you'll also have to tell the computer you're using pandas!)"
